# React Flow Diagram Tool

This project is a flow diagram tool built using `React Flow` that allows users to create and visualize flow diagrams with nodes and edges. It provides an interactive canvas where users can add custom nodes, create edges between nodes, and manipulate the flow structure visually.

## Features

### 1. **Interactive Flow Canvas**
   - A drag-and-drop canvas built using `React Flow` that allows users to interact with nodes and edges.
   - Users can drag nodes around the canvas to reposition them.
   - Clicking on a node displays its properties in the sidebar.

### 2. **Add Custom Nodes**
   - Users can create new nodes by providing:
     - A custom label for the node.
     - The `x` and `y` position coordinates where the node will be placed.
   - Nodes are dynamically added to the flow with their specified properties.

### 3. **Add Custom Edges**
   - Users can create edges between nodes by specifying:
     - The `source` node ID.
     - The `target` node ID.
   - Edges represent connections between nodes and allow users to illustrate relationships or sequences.

### 4. **View Node Properties**
   - Selecting a node displays detailed information about it in the sidebar, including:
     - Node `ID`.
     - Node position (`x` and `y` coordinates).
     - Node type (e.g., input, default).
   - This feature helps users understand the structure and relationships between nodes.

### 5. **Flow Controls**
   - Includes built-in controls such as:
     - **MiniMap**: Provides a small overview of the entire flow, allowing users to quickly navigate larger diagrams.
     - **Controls**: Includes zoom-in, zoom-out, and fit-to-view options.
     - **Background**: A customizable background grid with line variants for better visualization of node placements.

### 6. **Cursor Customization**
   - The cursor style can be adjusted dynamically to enhance the user experience while interacting with the canvas.

### 7. **Automatic ID Display**
   - Each node displays its `ID` along with its label, making it easier to identify nodes when creating edges.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **React Flow**: Library for building node-based UIs and flow diagrams.
- **JavaScript**: Core language for implementing logic.
- **CSS**: Custom styling to enhance the look and feel of the tool.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-flow-diagram-tool.git
   cd react-flow-diagram-tool
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open in your browser:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the flow diagram tool.

## Project Structure

- `src/FlowCanvas.js`: Main component that renders the flow canvas and manages nodes, edges, and interactions.
- `src/FlowCanvas.css`: Custom CSS for styling tooltips, nodes, and the overall layout.
- `src/index.js`: Entry point for the React application.

## Usage

- Use the **Create a New Node** section to add custom nodes by specifying a label and position.
- Use the **Create a New Edge** section to connect nodes by specifying source and target node IDs.
- Drag and drop nodes on the canvas to rearrange them.
- Click on nodes to view their details in the sidebar.

## Future Improvements

- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Add the ability to undo and redo changes made to the flow.
- **Export/Import Feature**: Allow users to save the current flow as JSON and load it later.
- **Custom Node Types**: Enable users to create nodes with custom shapes and styles.
- **Advanced Styling**: Improve the user interface with additional styling options for nodes and edges.
